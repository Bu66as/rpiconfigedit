# rpiconfigedit
Visual editor for the config.txt of a Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is very easy to install. Insert a SD card, create a image, connect power and everything is running. 
Everything great? Mostly yes, but if you have to manage special settings, itâ€™s a journey back to the 80s: config files!

This should be a little bit easier with this editor.
You'll find also some information on hackster and on my blog.

Have fun with it!

You find the compiled program under:
/run/windows for Microsoft Windows
/run/raspbian for the Raspberry Pi Linux

The Lazarus source code was created with Lazarus 2.0.0.

Feel free to send me suggestions for improvements.


PS: If you use the Linux version, set the correct permissions: chmod a+x rpiconfigedit
